Stage 2: Scenario 4 (Continued)

<!-- Instructions body -->
<p>Investors who choose Invest will win the 400 ECU prize if the majority of other Investors in their group (two or more) chose Invest <i><b>in Scenario 1</b></i> if the Advisor’s advice was Invest. This is shown in the table below. You will not know the quality of the investment opportunity for Scenario 4 when you decide to invest but notice that Quality does <b>not</b> matter for your payoff as an Investor.</p>
{{ include '_static/payoff_tables/investor.html' }}
<p class="extra-topmargin">As an Investor, your endowment will be randomly drawn from the numbers between 1 and 400. There was a separate draw for each Investor in Scenario 1, <b><i>so knowing your endowment in either Scenario 1 or Scenario 4 does not tell you anything about the endowments of other Investors</i></b>. As an Investor, you will select the minimum endowment for which you will choose Keep <i>if the Advisor’s advice in <b>Scenario 1</b> was Invest</i>. Your best choice as an Investor is always to set the minimum endowment exactly <b><i>equal</i></b> to the average amount you believe you will earn by choosing Invest. The average amount you will earn as an Investor if you choose Invest is the probability that you will win the prize multiplied by 400, where the probability of winning the prize is how likely you believe it is that the majority of other Investors in your group choose Invest <i><b>in Scenario 1</b> if the Advisor’s advice was Invest.</i></p>
