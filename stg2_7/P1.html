Stage 2: Scenario 4
{{ endblock }}

<!-- Instructions body -->
<p>This scenario has different rules from the other scenarios, so please listen carefully. An Investor’s payoffs will depend on what you choose in Scenario 4 and what the other members of your group chose <i><b>in Scenario 1</b></i>. In case you have forgotten, a recap of Investor’s instructions <i><b>for Scenario 1</b></i> follows. <b>When you make a choice there will be a button that lets you see the instructions for Scenario 1.</b></p>
<p class="sc4-sc1sum">Summary of Scenario 1 Instructions for Investors:</p>
<p>As an Investor, your payoffs in Scenario 1 were determined by the table shown below. If you chose Invest, you won the 400 ECU prize if Quality was High, <i><b>regardless of the number of other Investors who chose Invest</b></i>. </p>
{{ include '_static/payoff_tables/investor.html' }}
<p class="extra-topmargin">Each Investor’s endowment was randomly drawn from the numbers between 1 and 400. There was a separate draw for each Investor, <i><b>so knowing your endowment did not tell you anything about the endowments of other Investors</b></i>. </p>
<p>An Investor’s best choice was to set the slider exactly <i><b>equal</b></i> to the average amount you believed you would earn by choosing Invest. The average amount you would earn as an Investor by choosing Invest is the probability of winning the prize multiplied by 400, where the probability of winning was the probability that Quality was High <i>if the Advisor’s advice was Invest</i>.</p>
