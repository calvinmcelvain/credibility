<p class="extra-topmargin">As in Scenario 1, each Investor’s endowment will be randomly drawn from the numbers between 0 and 400. As an Investor, you will select the minimum endowment for which you will choose Keep <b><i>if the Advisor’s advice is Invest</i></b>.</p>
<p>In thinking about what minimum endowment to choose, think about how likely you are to win the prize if you choose Invest. The more likely you are to win, the higher you should set your minimum endowment. <b><i>In Scenario 2, the probability of winning the prize is how likely you believe that the majority of Investors in your group will choose Invest when the Advisor tells you to pick Invest</i></b>.</p>
