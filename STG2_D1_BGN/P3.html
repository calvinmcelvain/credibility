Stage 2 (cont.)

<!-- General Information Body -->
<p>There are also a number of differences between Stage 2 and Stage 1</p>
<div class="List">
    <p><b>1)</b>	The payoff tables will change for each decision in Stage 2. Be certain to look at the payoff tables and instructions before making your decisions in Stage 2, as these will <span style="color: red">not</span> be the same as Stage 1 or the other decisions in Stage 2. </p>
    <p><b>2)</b>	The outside option is <span style="color: red">not</span> the same for every decision in Stage 2. Instead, an outside option will be randomly drawn for each decision. Later in these instructions, you will receive more instructions on exactly how this works and how you will make choices.</p>
    <p><b>3)</b>    In Stage 2, there now will only be two possible quality levels, “Low” and “High”. Each possible quality level is equally likely, like the flip of a coin. </p>
    <p><b>4)</b>    In Stage 2, rather than receiving an estimate, the Advisor will directly observe the true quality level. In other words, the Advisor will know the actual quality level (rather than an estimate) when they choose a message. </p>
    <p><b>5)</b>    The stakes for each decision in Stage 2 are substantially higher than those in Stage 1. Also remember that you will make a total of three decisions, but only one will be randomly chosen to count towards your earnings in today’s experiment.</p>
    <p><b>6)</b>    Unlike Stage 1, you will not see feedback after each decision.  In other words, you will make all three decisions without seeing any results before advancing to the next decision. At the end of Stage 2, you will see the results from all three decisions and will learn which decision has been randomly chosen to count towards your payment. You will also see your total earnings from Stage 1, and your total earnings from today’s session.</p>
    <p><b>7)</b>    Rather than choosing “Invest” or “Keep” directly, in Stage 2, Investors will choose threshold levels of the outside option that will determine their investment decision.  We will explain this in detail now.</p>
