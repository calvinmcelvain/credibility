<p>Investors’ payoffs are determined by the table shown below. Investors who invest will receive earnings of 300 if the Quality is High, <span style="color: red">regardless of the number of other Investors who invest. </span></p>
<p>As before, you will receive a recommendation from the Advisor but will <span style="color: red">not</span> know the quality level of the investment opportunity when you decide to invest.</p>
{{ include '_static/payoff_tables/stage_2/investor.html' }}
<p>As explained previously, the outside option will be randomly drawn from the numbers between 1 and 300. Investors will select a <span style="color: red">mininum</span> outside option for which you will choose to invest, otherwise, you will receive your minimum outside option. As shown in the example previously, your best choice is to set the slider <span style="color: red">equal</span> to the outside option where you would switch from choosing to invest to taking the outside option.</p>
<p>After completing Decision 3, all participants will see the results from all decisions made in Stage 2, as well as the decision that has been drawn to count towards your payment.  You will also see your total earnings from Stage 1, and your total earnings from today’s session.</p>
