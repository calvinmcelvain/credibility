<p>There are several other ways that Stage 2 will be different from Stage 1.</p>
<div class="List">
    <ol>
        <li>In Stage 2, there now will only be two possible quality levels, “Low” and “High”. Each possible quality level is equally likely, like the flip of a coin.</li>
        <li>In Stage 2, rather than receiving an estimate, the Advisor will directly observe the true quality level. In other words, the Advisor will know the actual quality level <b><i>for certain</i></b> when they choose a message, rather than only having a noisy estimate.</li>
        <li>Unlike Stage 1, you will not see feedback after each decision. After you have made all three decisions, you will see the results from all three decisions and will learn which of these three decisions has been randomly chosen to count towards your payment.</li>
        <li>The stakes for each decision in Stage 2 are <b><i>substantially higher</i></b> than those in Stage 1.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>As you look at the payoff tables, notice that the possible payoffs are much higher for both Advisors and Investors.</li>
            <li>The range of possible outside options for Investors will be between 1 and 300 ECUs. Notice that the highest possible outside option is much higher than the outside option in Stage 1 or the highest possible outside option in the slider training.</li>
        </ol>
