<p>Investors who do not choose to invest will receive their outside option. In Stage 2, the outside option for each investor will be randomly drawn from the numbers between 0 and 300. All numbers are equally likely to be drawn.</p>
<p style="margin-top: unset">Each investor will use a slider to select the <span style="color: red">minimum</span> outside option for which you will choose <span style="color: red">not</span> to invest.</p>
<div class="List">
    <ul>
        <li>Any outside option below your minimum will result in you choosing to Invest.</li>
        <li>If an outside option is drawn at or above your minimum, you will <span style="color: red">not</span> Invest. You will receive the outside option.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>As an investor, your best choice is always to set the slider exactly <span style="color: red">equal</span> to the value you believe you will earn on average by choosing Invest.</p>
