<p>Investors who do not choose to invest will receive their outside option. In Stage 2, the outside option will be randomly drawn from a range of numbers. Each investor will use a slider like the one you see below to select the <b><i>minimum</i></b> outside option for which you will choose <b><i>not</i></b> to invest.</p>
<div class="List">
    <ul>
        <li>Any outside option below your minimum will result in you choosing to Invest.</li>
        <li>If an outside option is drawn at or above your minimum, you will <b><i>not</i></b> Invest. You will receive the outside option.</li>
        <li>As an investor, our advice is that you set the slider exactly <span style="color: red">equal</span> to the value you believe you will earn on average by choosing Invest. This will always earn you at least as much money as you would have earned by choosing something else.</li>
    </ul>
