<p>As an investor, your best choice is always to set the slider exact <span style="color: red">equal</span> to the value you believe you will earn on average by choosing Invest.</p>
<p>To help you understand why this is true, you will now complete a short training exercise.</p>
<div class="List">
    <ul>
        <li>There are 10 rounds in the training exercise. You will be paid for one randomly selected round of the training exercise.</li>
        <li>In each round, the computer will randomly select a value that you will earn by choosing Invest. You will know the randomly selected value. You will earn this value <span style="color: red">for certain</span> if you choose Invest.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>In each round, you will use a slider to select the <span style="color: red">minimum</span> outside option for which you will choose not to invest.</p>
