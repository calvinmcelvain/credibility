<p>As an investor, your best choice is always to set the slider exact <span style="color: red">equal</span> to the value you believe you will earn on average by choosing Invest.</p>
<p>To help you understand why this is true, you will now complete a short training exercise.</p>
<div class="List">
    <ul>
        <li>There are 5 rounds in the training exercise.</li>
        <li>In each round, the computer will randomly select a value that you will earn by choosing Invest. You will know the randomly selected value. You will earn this value <span style="color: red">for certain</span> if you choose Invest.</li>
        <li>In each round, you will use a slider to select the <span style="color: red">minimum</span> outside option for which you will choose not to invest.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>Our advice is that you should always set the slider exactly <span style="color: red">equal</span> to the value. This will always earn you at least as much money as you would have earned by choosing something else.</p>
<p>After you see the value and choose your minimum outside option in each round, the computer will randomly draw twenty numbers between 0 and 300</p>
<div class="List">
    <ul>
        <li>A draw below your minimum will result you choosing to Invest. You will receive the value.</li>
        <li>If a draw is at or above your minimum, you will <span style="color: red">not</span> Invest. You will receive the outside option.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>One of the 50 choices you make across the five rounds will randomly be selected for payment.</p>
