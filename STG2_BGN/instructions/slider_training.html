<p>As an investor, your best choice is always to set the slider exact <b><i>equal</i></b> to the value you believe you will earn on average by choosing Invest.</p>
<p>To help you understand why this is true, you will now complete a short training exercise.</p>
<div class="List">
    <ul>
        <li>There are 5 rounds in the training exercise.</li>
        <li>In each round, the computer will randomly select a value that you will earn by choosing Invest.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>You will know the randomly selected value.</li>
            <li>You will earn this value <b><i>for certain</i></b> if you choose Invest.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>In each round, you will use a slider to select the <b><i>minimum</i></b> outside option for which you will choose not to invest.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>After you see the value and choose your minimum outside option in each round, the computer will randomly draw twenty numbers between 1 and 50.</p>
<div class="List">
    <ul>
        <li>A draw below your minimum will result in you choosing to Invest. You will receive the value.</li>
        <li>If a draw is at or above your minimum, you will <b><i>not</i></b> Invest. You will receive the outside option.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>Our advice is that you should always set the slider exactly <span style="color: red">equal</span> to the value. This will always earn you at least as much money as you would have earned by choosing something else.</p>
