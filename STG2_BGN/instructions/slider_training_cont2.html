<p>After each round, you will receive feedback. This will show you the twenty randomly drawn outside options. For each outside option, the feedback will show you four things:</p>
<div class="List">
    <ul>
        <li>The value of the outside option.</li>
        <li>What you earn given the minimum outside option you picked with the slider</li>
        <li>What you would have earned if you had set the minimum outside option equal to the value</li>
        <li>The difference between these two numbers</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>As an investor, your best choice is always to set the slider exactly <span style="color: red">equal</span> to the value.</p>
<p>The feedback will highlight in <span style="background-color: red">red</span> all outside options where you would have earned <span style="color: red">more</span> by setting the slider equal to the value than the minimum outside option you chose.</p>
<p>The feedback will highlight in <span style="background-color: greenyellow">green</span> all outside options where you would have earned <span style="color: green">less</span> by setting the slider equal to the value than the minimum outside option you chose.</p>
<p>One outside option will randomly be selected for payment. Your payoff is highlighted in <span style="background-color: yellow">yellow</span>.</p>
