<!-- General Information Body -->
<p>We have now concluded Stage 1 of the experiment. Stage 2 will consist of a series of three decisions. One decision will be drawn after the experiment to count towards your payment.  Because you will not know which decision will count until the end of the experiment, you should treat each decision as if it is the one that counts.</p>
<p>Your group in Stage 2 is the same six participants as in Stage 1 and your role (Advisor or Investor) is the same as well.</p>
