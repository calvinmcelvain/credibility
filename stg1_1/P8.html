Advisor's Information
{{ endblock }}

<!-- Instructions body -->
<p>In each round, the Advisor will receive an estimate of the quality of the investment opportunity. This estimate is <i>private</i> information. In other words, the Advisor can see the estimate, but the Investors will never be told what estimate their group’s Advisor received.</p>
<p>There is an 5/6 chance that the estimate the Advisor receives is correct and a 1/6 chance that it is incorrect. You can think of this like rolling a single die. If the computer rolls a 1 through 5, the Advisor receives a correct estimate. If the computer rolls a 6, the Advisor receive an incorrect estimate.</p>
<p>If the Advisor receives an <i><b>incorrect</b></i> estimate, each of the two possible incorrect levels is equally likely. In other words, if the estimate is <b><i>not</i></b> equal to the true quality of the investment opportunity, there is a 1 in 2 chance (like flipping a coin) that it is equal to each of the other possible qualities.</p>
<p>As an example, if the Quality in a round is High, then there is a 5 in 6 chance that the Advisor will receive an estimate equal to “High”, and there is a 1 in 6 that the Advisor will receive an estimate equal to one of the other possible values of Quality (“Low” or “Medium”). Each of the other possible estimates is equally likely.</p>
<p>This estimate is <i>private</i> information. In other words, the Advisor can see the estimate, but the Investors will never be told what estimate their group’s Advisor received.</p>
