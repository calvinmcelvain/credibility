Description of Investor Payoffs
{{ endblock }}

<!-- Instructions body -->
<p>If you are an Investor and you choose to <i>Keep</i> your endowment, you will retain your initial 12 ECU. This will be your payoff for the round. </p>
<p>If you are a Investor and choose to invest your endowment, you will give up your 12 ECU endowment and your payoff will depend on the total number of Investors in your group, including you, that invest (<i>Total Investors</i>) and the quality of the investment opportunity (<i>Quality</i>). </p>
<p><i>Quality</i> will be drawn randomly in each round from three possible levels: Low, Medium, or High. Each quality level is equally likely to be drawn. In other words, the chance of each of level being drawn is 1/3. You can imagine that the computer rolls a single six-sided die at the beginning of each round. If the roll is a 1 or 2, the quality is low. If the roll is a 3 or 4, the quality is medium. And if the computer rolls a 5 or 6, the quality is high. A new quality level is drawn in each round (i.e. a new die roll), so knowing the quality drawn in the previous round tells you nothing about the quality drawn for the current round. <b>You will not know the quality level of the investment opportunity when you decide to invest. </b></p>
