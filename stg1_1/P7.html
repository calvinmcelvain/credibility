Description of Advisor Payoffs
{{ endblock }}

<!-- Instructions body -->
<p>If you are a Advisor, your payoffs will depend on the total number of investors in your group that invest (<i>Total Investors</i>) and on the quality level of the investment opportunity (<i>Quality</i>). </p>
<p>The payoff table below shows a Advisorâ€™s payoffs for each possible combination of how many Investors in the group invest (<i>Total Investors</i>) and the <i>Quality</i> of the investment opportunity. </p>
{{ include '_static/payoff_tables/advisor.html' }}
<p>Please look at an overhead screen as we go through some examples on how to read the <i>Advisor's</i> payoff tables. </p>
