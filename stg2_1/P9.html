<div class="List">
    <ol>
        <li>In Stage 2, there will only be two possible quality levels, “Low” and “High”. Each possible quality level is equally likely, like the flip of a coin.</li>
        <li>In Stage 2, rather than receiving an estimate, the Advisor will directly observe the true quality level. In other words, the Advisor will be able to send advice based on the actual quality of the investment opportunity rather than a noisy estimate of the quality. As in Stage 1, the Advisor will choose advice for each possible quality level (Low or High).</li>
        <li>Unlike Stage 1, Investors will only choose “Invest” or “Keep” <b><i>if the Advisor advises Invest</i></b>.</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>You will keep your endowment for certain <b><i>if your Advisor advises Keep</i></b>.</li>
            <li>If the Advisor advises Invest, Investors will choose “Invest” or “Keep” based on their choice of a minimum endowment. If the randomly drawn endowment is below their minimum endowment, the Investor chooses Invest. If the randomly drawn endowment is at or above their minimum endowment, the Investor chooses Keep.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Unlike Stage 1, you will not see feedback after choosing in each scenario. You will see your feedback only after completing your decisions in all scenarios.</li>
        <li>You will make choices for four scenarios in Stage 2. One of the four scenarios will be randomly chosen to count towards your earnings in today’s experiment.</li>
    </ol>
