<p>For all the scenarios in Stage 2, Investors have a chance of winning a prize worth 400 ECU (400 ECU = $16).</p>
<p>The average amount you will earn as an Investor if you choose Invest is the probability that you will win the prize multiplied by 400.</p>
<div class="List">
    <ul>
        <li>For example, suppose you think there is a 25% chance you will win the prize. The average amount you will earn as an Investor in you choose Invest is .25 x 400 = 100 ECU.</li>
        <li>If you think there is a 75% chance you will win the prize, the average amount you will earn as an Investor if you choose Invest is .75 x 400 = 300 ECU. </li>
        <li>The higher the chance you will win the prize, the more you will win on average.</li>
