Choosing a Minimum Endowment
{{ endblock }}

<!-- Instructions body -->
<p>You will use an interface like the one shown on the screen to choose the minimum endowment for which you will select Keep. There is a slider, a text box labeled “minimum endowment” next to the slider, and a text box labeled “probability” below the slider. You can choose a minimum endowment three ways: moving the slider, entering a minimum endowment into the text box labeled “minimum endowment”, or entering a probability of winning the prize into the text box labeled “probability”.</p>
<p>Please look at the overhead as I go through some examples of how to use the slider, the minimum endowment text box, and the probability text box.</p>
