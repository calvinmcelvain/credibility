<!-- Instructions body -->
<p>Investors’ payoffs are determined by the table shown below. Investors who choose Invest will win the 400 ECU prize if  <i>Quality</i> is High, <b><i>regardless of the number of other Investors who choose Invest</i></b>.</p>
<p>As in Stage 1, you will receive advice from the Advisor but will <b><i>not</i></b> know the quality of the investment opportunity when you decide to invest.</p>
{{ include '_static/payoff_tables/investor.html' }}
<p class="extra-topmargin">Each Investor’s endowment will be randomly drawn from the numbers between 0 and 400. As an Investor, you will select the minimum endowment for which you will choose Keep <b><i>if the Advisor’s advice is Invest</i></b>.</p>
<p>In thinking about what minimum endowment to choose, think about how likely you are to win the prize if you choose Invest. The more likely you are to win, the higher you should set your minimum endowment. <b><i>In Scenario 1, the probability of winning the prize is how likely you believe that Quality is High when the Advisor tells you to pick Invest</i></b>.</p>
