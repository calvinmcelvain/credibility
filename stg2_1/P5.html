Minimum Endowments
{{ endblock }}

<!-- Instructions body -->
<p>Investors who choose “Keep” will be paid their endowment. In Stage 2, the endowment for each scenario will be randomly drawn between 0 ECU and 400 ECU. All numbers in this range, including 0 and 400, are equally likely. Endowments are drawn separately for each Investor; knowing your endowment does not tell you anything about the endowment for other Investors. Each Investor will choose the <b><i>minimum</i></b> endowment for which you will choose Keep.</p>
<div class="List">
    <ul>
        <li>Any endowment below your minimum will result in you choosing to Invest. You will give up your endowment and be paid based on the payoff table for that decision.</li>
        <li>If an endowment is drawn at or above your minimum, you will choose Keep. You will be paid your endowment.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>Please look at the overhead for additional explanation on how minimum endowments work.</p>
