Description of Player B Information About Quality of the Investment Opportunity
{{ endblock }}

<!--Description Body-->
<p>In each round, the Player A will receive an estimate of the quality of the investment opportunity. There is an 5/6 chance that the estimate Player A receives is correct and a 1/6 chance that it is incorrect. In other words, there is a 5 in 6 chance that the estimate Player A receives will be exactly equal to the true quality level of the investment opportunity, and a 1 in 6 chance that the estimate Player A receives will be equal to some level other than the true quality of the investment opportunity. You can think of this like rolling a single die. If the computer rolls a 1 through 5, Player A receives a correct estimate. If a 6 is rolled, Player A receives an incorrect estimate.</p>
<p>If Player A receives an incorrect estimate, each of the two possible incorrect levels is equally likely. In other words, if the estimate is <i><b>not</b></i> equal to the true quality of the investment opportunity, there is a 1 in 2 chance (like flipping a coin) that it is equal to each of the other possible qualities. </p>
<p>So, for example, if the <i>Quality</i> in a round is High, then there is a 83.3 percent (5 in 6) chance that Player B will receive an estimate equal to “High”, and there is a 16.7 percent (1 in 6) that Player A will receive an estimate equal to one of the other possible values of <i>Quality</i> (“Low” or “Medium”). Each of the other possible estimates is equally likely. </p>
<p>This estimate is <i>private</i> information. In other words, the Player A can see the estimate, but the Player Bs will never be told what estimate their group’s Player A received.</p>
