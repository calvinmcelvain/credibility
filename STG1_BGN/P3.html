<!--Instructions Body-->
<h3>Description of Stages, Rounds, and Groups</h3>
<p>This experiment will consist of two stages. Right now we will only go through the instructions for Stage 1. You will receive instructions for Stage 2 after Stage 1 concludes. </p>
<p>Stage 1 will last for 30 rounds. In each round, you will be in a six-person group with five other participants. The participants you are grouped with will be the same for all rounds of Stage 1. </p>
<p>Your group will consist of participants in two roles. Five of the participants will participate in the experiment in the role of <i>Player A</i>. The remaining participants in each group will be in the role of <i>Player B</i>. </p>
<p>You will be informed of your role (<i>Player A</i> or <i>Player B</i>) prior to the beginning of Stage 1.</p>

<h3>Description of the Decision Tasks in Stage 1</h3>
<p>The five Player Bs in each group will begin each round with an endowment of 12 ECU. If you are a Player B, you will decide individually whether to invest your 12 ECU endowment into an investment opportunity or to keep it. You cannot split your endowment – you must either invest all 12 ECU or keep all 12 ECU. Therefore, each Player B’s only decision in each round is whether to invest or keep their endowment.</p>
<p>Before the Player Bs make their decisions, the Player A in each group will receive an estimate of the quality of the investment opportunity. We will explain the details of this estimate later in the instructions. After seeing their estimate, the Player A will then send a message to all Player Bs in the group. This message will include a recommendation: either “Invest” or “Do Not Invest.” </p>
<p>All Player Bs will receive the same message from the Player A. They can see the message, but not Player A’s estimate. After receiving Player A’s message, all Player Bs will make their investment decisions at the same time.  This means that Player Bs will not know whether the other members of their group have invested or not when making their own decisions.</p>
