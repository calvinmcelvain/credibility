<b><u>Advisor's Information (Continued)</u></b>

<!--Description Body-->
<p>If the Advisor receives an incorrect estimate, each of the two possible incorrect levels is equally likely. In other words, if the estimate is <b><i>not</i></b> equal to the true quality of the investment opportunity, there is a 1 in 2 chance (like flipping a coin) that it is equal to each of the other possible qualities.</p>
<p>So, for example, if the <i>Quality</i> in a round is High, then there is a 83.3 percent (5 in 6) chance that the Investor will receive an estimate equal to “High”, and there is a 16.7 percent (1 in 6) that the Advisor will receive an estimate equal to one of the other possible values of <i>Quality</i> (“Low” or “Medium”). Each of the other possible estimates is equally likely. </p>
<p>This estimate is <i>private</i> information. In other words, the Advisor can see the estimate, but the Investors will never be told what estimate their group’s Advisor received.</p>
