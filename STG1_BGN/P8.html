Advisor's Information
{{ endblock }}

<!--Description Body-->
<p>In each round, the Advisor will receive an estimate of the quality of the investment opportunity. This estimate is <i>private</i> information. In other words, the Advisor can see the estimate, but the Investors will never be told what estimate their groupâ€™s Advisor received.</p>
<p>There is an 5/6 chance that the estimate the Advisor receives is correct and a 1/6 chance that it is incorrect. In other words, there is a 5 in 6 chance that the estimate the Advisor receives will be exactly equal to the true quality level of the investment opportunity, and a 1 in 6 chance that the estimate the Advisor receives will be equal to some level other than the true quality of the investment opportunity. You can think of this like rolling a single die. If the computer rolls a 1 through 5, the Advisor receives a correct estimate. If a 6 is rolled, the Advisor receives an incorrect estimate.</p>
