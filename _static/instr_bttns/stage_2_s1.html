There is a separate draw for each Investor, so knowing your endowment does not tell you anything about the endowments of other Investors.

Your best choice as an Investor is always to set the minimum endowment exactly <b><i>equal</i></b> to the average amount you believe you will earn by choosing Invest. The average amount you will earn as an Investor if you choose Invest is the probability that you will win the prize multiplied by 400, where the probability of winning the prize is how likely you believe that <i>Quality</i> is High <i>if the Advisor’s advice is Invest</i>.</p>
