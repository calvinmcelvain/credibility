          <h3>Scenario 2</h3>
          <p>As in all scenarios, the Advisor will receive 100 for each Investor who chooses Invest. This is shown in the payoff table below. The Advisor’s payoff does not depend on the quality of the investment opportunity.</p>

          <p class="extra-topmargin">As an Advisor, you will receive a signal telling you the quality of the investment opportunity. That signal will <b><i>always</i></b> be correct. You will select what advice to send the Investors for each possible signal (Low or High).</p>

          <h3>Scenario 2 (Continued)</h3>
          <p>Investors who choose Invest will win the 400 ECU prize if the majority of Investors in their group (three or more) choose Invest, regardless of <i>Quality</i>. This is shown in the table below. As before, you will not know the quality of the investment opportunity when you decide to invest. Notice that <i>Quality</i> does <b><i>not</i></b> matter for the payoff of either the Advisor or Investors.</p>

          <p class="extra-topmargin">As in Scenario 1, each Investor’s endowment will be randomly drawn from the numbers between 1 and 400. There is a separate draw for each Investor, so knowing your endowment does not tell you anything about the endowments of other Investors. As an Investor, you will select the minimum endowment for which you will choose Keep <i></i>. Your best choice as an Investor is always to set the minimum endowment exactly <b><i>equal</i></b> to the average amount you believe you will earn by choosing Invest. The average amount you will earn as an Investor if you choose Invest is the probability that you will win the prize multiplied by 400, where the probability of winning the prize is how likely you believe that the majority of other Investors in your group choose Invest <i>if the Advisor’s advice is Invest</i>, regardless of <i>Quality</i>.</p>
