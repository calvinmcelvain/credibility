<p>There are several other ways that Stage 2 will be different from Stage 1.</p>
<div class="List">
    <ol>
        <li>In Stage 2, there now will only be two possible quality levels, “Low” and “High”. Each possible quality level is equally likely, like the flip of a coin.</li>
        <li>In Stage 2, rather than receiving an estimate, the Advisor will directly observe the true quality level. In other words, the Advisor will know the actual quality level (rather than an estimate) when they choose what advice to send.</li>
        <li>Unlike Stage 1, you will not see feedback after each decision. After you have made all three decisions, you will see the results from all three decisions and will learn which of these three decisions has been randomly chosen to count towards your payment.</li>
        <li>Investors will not choose “Invest” or “Keep” directly. If the Advisor advises Keep, investors will automatically make the decision to Keep (this is almost certainly the best option for investors). Investors will use a slider to choose the minimum endowment for which they will choose Keep <b><i>if the Advisor advises Invest.</i></b></li>
        <li>5.	The stakes for each decision in Stage 2 are substantially higher than those in Stage 1. Also remember that you will make a total of three decisions, but only one will be randomly chosen to count towards your earnings in today’s experiment.</li>
    </ol>
