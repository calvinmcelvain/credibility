        <li>In Stage 2, there now will only be two possible quality levels, “Low” and “High”. Each possible quality level is equally likely, like the flip of a coin.</li>
        <li>In Stage 2, rather than receiving an estimate, the Advisor will directly observe the true quality level. In other words, the Advisor will be able to send advice based on the actual quality of the investment opportunity rather than a noisy estimate of the quality. As in Stage 1, the Advisor will choose advice for each possible quality level (Low or High).</li>
        <li>Investors will not choose “Invest” or “Keep” directly.<b><i></i> If the Advisor advises Keep, investors will automatically be assigned Keep. In other words, you will keep your endowment for certain if your Advisor advises Keep</b>. Investors will use a slider to choose the minimum endowment for which they will choose Keep <b><i>if the Advisor advises Invest</i></b>. When you are using the slider, this choice will only be used <b><i>if the Advisor advises Invest</i></b>.</li>
        <li>Unlike Stage 1, you will not see feedback after each decision. After all three decisions have been made for Stage 2, you will see the results from all three decisions and will learn which decision has been randomly chosen to count towards your payment. You will also see your total earnings from Stage 1, and your total earnings from today’s session.</li>
        <li>5.	The stakes for each decision in Stage 2 are <b><i>substantially higher</i></b> than those in Stage 1. Also remember that you will make a total of three decisions, but only one will be randomly chosen to count towards your earnings in today’s experiment.</li>
