<p>Investors who choose to invest will earn 300 if the majority of Investors in their group (three or more) choose Invest, regardless of <i>Quality</i>. This is shown in the table below. As before, you will not know the quality of the investment opportunity when you decide to invest. Notice that <i>Quality</i> does <b>not</b> matter for the payoff of either the Advisor or Investors.</p>

<p>As in Scenario 1, each Investor’s endowment will be randomly drawn from the numbers between 1 and 300. There is a separate draw for each Investor, so knowing your endowment does not tell you anything about the endowments of other Investors. As an Investor, you will use a slider to select the minimum endowment for which you will choose Keep <b><i>if the Advisor’s advice is Invest</i></b>. Your best choice is to set the slider exactly <span style="color: red;">equal</span> to the value you believe you will earn on average by choosing Invest.</p>
