<p>In Stage 2, the payoff table for Investors will change. Investors who choose to invest will earn 300 if the majority of Investors in their group (three or more) choose to invest, <b><i>regardless of Quality</i></b>. This is shown in the table below. Notice that Quality does <b><i>not</i></b> matter for the payoff of either the Advisor or Investors.</p>

<p>As in Decision 1, any Investor who chooses not to invest will receive their outside option which will be randomly chosen from the numbers between 1 and 300. Investors will again use a slider to choose the minimum outside option for which they will <b><i>not</i></b> invest.</p>
