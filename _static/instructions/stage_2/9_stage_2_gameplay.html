        <li>In Stage 2, there now will only be two possible quality levels, “Low” and “High”. Each possible quality level is equally likely, like the flip of a coin.</li>
        <li>In Stage 2, rather than receiving an estimate, the Advisor will directly observe the true quality level. In other words, the Advisor will be able to send advice based on the actual quality of the investment opportunity rather than a noisy estimate of the quality. As in Stage 1, the Advisor will choose advice for each possible quality level (Low or High).</li>
        <li>Unlike Stage 1, Investors will only choose “Invest” or “Keep” <b><i>if the Advisor advises Invest</i></b>.</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li class="nomargin">If the Advisor advises Keep, you will keep your endowment for certain if your Advisor advises Keep. </li>
            <li class="nomargin">If the Advisor advises Invest, Investors will choose “Invest” or “Keep” based on their slider choice. Remember, the slider used to choose the minimum endowment for which an Invest will choose Keep. </li>
