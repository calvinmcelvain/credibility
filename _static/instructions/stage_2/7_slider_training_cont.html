<p>In each round, after you see the value of investing and use the slider to choose the minimum endowment for which you will choose Keep in each round, the computer will randomly draw twenty endowments between 0 ECU and 50 ECU. As before 25 ECU equal a dollar.</p>
<div class="List">
    <ul>
        <li>A randomly drawn endowment below your minimum will result in you choosing to Invest. You will receive the value of investing</li>
        <li>If a randomly drawn endowment is at or above your minimum, you will choose Keep. You will receive the randomly drawn endowment.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>The first two rounds are practice. We advise that you make your choices randomly. This will help you understand how the slider and the payoffs work.</p>
<p>You will be paid your average payoff from the last three rounds. As before 25 ECU equal a dollar. This will be added to your total payoff at the end of the experiment.</p>
<p>For the last three rounds of the training exercise, when you are being paid, our advice is that you should always set the slider exactly <i><b>equal</b></i> to the value of investing. This must be the amount you will earn on average by choosing Invest. Following our advice will always earn you at least as much money as you would have earned by choosing something else.</p>
