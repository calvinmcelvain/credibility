<p>After each round, you will receive feedback. This will show you the twenty randomly drawn endowments. For each endowment, the feedback will show you four things:</p>
<div class="List">
    <ul>
        <li>The endowment</li>
        <li>What you earned given the minimum endowment you chose using the slider (”Your Choice”)</li>
        <li>What you would have earned if you had set the minimum endowment equal to the value of investing <b><i>as we advise</i></b> (“Our Advice”)</li>
        <li>The difference between what you would have earned from following our advice and what you earned from your choice.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>As an investor, your best choice is always to set the slider exactly <b><i>equal</i></b> to the value of investing.</p>
<p>The feedback will highlight in <span style="background-color: greenyellow">green</span> all cases where you earned <b><i>more</i></b> from your choice than if you had followed our advice.</p>
<p>The feedback will highlight in <span style="background-color: red">red</span> all cases where you earned <b><i>less</i></b> from your choice than if you had followed our advice.</p>
