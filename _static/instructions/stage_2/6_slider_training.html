<p>As an investor, your best choice is always to set the slider exact <b><i>equal</i></b> to the value you believe you will earn on average by choosing Invest.</p>
<p>To help you understand why this is true, you will now complete a short training exercise.</p>
<div class="List">
    <ul>
        <li>There are 5 rounds in the training exercise.</li>
        <li>In each round, the computer will randomly select a value of investing. This is the amount that you will earn by choosing Invest.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>You will know the randomly selected value of investing.</li>
            <li>You will earn the value of investing <b><i>for certain</i></b> if you choose Invest.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>In each round, you will use a slider to select the <b><i>minimum</i></b> endowment for which you will choose Keep.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>After you see the value of investing and choose the minimum endowment for which you will choose Keep in each round, the computer will randomly draw twenty endowments between 0 ECU and 50 ECU. As before 25 ECU equal a dollar.</p>
<div class="List">
    <ul>
        <li>A randomly drawn endowment below your minimum will result in you choosing to Invest. You will receive the value of investing</li>
        <li>If a randomly drawn endowment is at or above your minimum, you will choose Keep. You will receive the randomly drawn endowment.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>One of the 100 choices you make across the five rounds will randomly be selected for payment. This will be added to your total payoff at the end of the experiment.</p>
<p>Our advice is that you should always set the slider exactly <i><b>equal</b></i> to the value of investing (since this must be the amount you will earn on average by choosing Invest). This will always earn you at least as much money as you would have earned by choosing something else.</p>
