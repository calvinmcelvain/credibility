<p>As an Investor, your best choice is always to set the slider exactly <b><i>equal</i></b> to the value you believe you will earn on average by choosing Invest.</p>
<p>To help you understand why this is true, you will now complete a short training exercise.</p>
<div class="List">
    <ul>
        <li>There are 5 rounds in the training exercise. The first two rounds are for practice and will not be paid. The last three rounds will be paid.</li>
        <li>In each round, there will be a value of investing. This is the amount that you will earn <b><i>for certain</i></b> by choosing Invest. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>You will know the randomly selected value of investing.</li>
            <li>You will earn the value of investing <b><i>for certain</i></b> if you choose Invest.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>In each round, you will use a slider to select the <b><i>minimum</i></b> endowment for which you will choose Keep.</li>
    </ul>
