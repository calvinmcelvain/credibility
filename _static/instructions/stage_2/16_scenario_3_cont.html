<p>Investors who choose Invest will earn 300 if the majority of Investors in their group (three or more) choose Invest <b><i>and</i></b> <i>Quality</i> is High. Unlike Scenario 2, the payoff of an Investor depends on the quality of the investment opportunity.</p>

<p>As in Scenarios 1 and 2, each Investor’s endowment will be randomly drawn from the numbers between 1 and 300. There is a separate draw for each Investor, so knowing your endowment does not tell you anything about the endowments of other Investors. As an Investor, you will use a slider to select the minimum endowment for which you will choose Keep <b><i>if the Advisor’s advice is Invest</i></b>. Your best choice is to set the slider exactly <span style="color: red;">equal</span> to the value you believe you will earn on average by choosing Invest.</p>
