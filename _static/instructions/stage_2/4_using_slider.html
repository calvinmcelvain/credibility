<p>Investors who choose “Keep” will be paid their endowment. In Stage 2, the endowment will be randomly drawn from a range of numbers. Endowments are drawn separately for each Investor; knowing your endowment does not tell you anything about the endowment for other Investors. Each Investor will use a slider like the one you see below to select the <i><b>minimum</b></i> endowment for which you will choose Keep.</p>
<div class="List">
    <ul>
        <li>Any endowment below your minimum will result in you choosing to Invest. You will give up your endowment and be paid based on the payoff table for that decision.</li>
        <li>If an endowment is drawn at or above your minimum, you will choose Keep. You will be paid your endowment.</li>
        <li>As an investor, our advice is that you set the slider exactly <i><b>equal</b></i> to the value you believe you will earn on average by choosing Invest. This will always earn you at least as much money as you would have earned by choosing something else.</li>
        <li>Please look at the overhead as I go through some examples of how to use the slider.</li>
    </ul>
