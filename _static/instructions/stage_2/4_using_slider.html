<p>Investors who do not choose to invest will receive their initial endowment. In Stage 2, the endowment will be randomly drawn from a range of numbers. Each investor will use a slider like the one you see below to select the <i><b>minimum</b></i> endowment for which you will choose Keep.</p>
<div class="List">
    <ul>
        <li>Any endowment below your minimum will result in you choosing to Invest.</li>
        <li>If an endowment is drawn at or above your minimum, you will choose Keep. You will receive the your endowment.</li>
        <li>As an investor, our advice is that you set the slider exactly <i><b>equal</b></i> to the value you believe you will earn on average by choosing Invest. This will always earn you at least as much money as you would have earned by choosing something else.</li>
    </ul>
