<p>In all of the scenarios in Stage 2, Investors have a chance of winning a prize worth 400 ECU (400 ECU = $16). The average amount you will earn as an Investor is the probability that you will win the prize multiplied by 400. For example, suppose you think there is a 25% chance you will win the prize. The average amount you will earn as an Investor is .25 x 400 = 100 ECU. If you think there is a 75% chance you will win the prize, the average amount you will earn as an Investor is .75 x 400 = 300 ECU. The higher the chance you will win the prize, the more you will win on average.</p>

<p>Your best choice as an Investor is always to set the slider exactly <b><i>equal</i></b> to the average amount you believe you will earn by choosing Invest</p>

<p>To help you understand how the sliders work and why you should follow our advice, we will go through a practice round after we have finished how play will work in Stage 2.</p>
