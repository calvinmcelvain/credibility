<p>Investors’ payoffs are determined by the table shown below. Investors who choose Invest will receive earnings of 300 ECU if <i>Quality</i> is High, <b><i>regardless of the number of other Investors who choose Invest</i></b>.</p>
<p>As in Stage 1, you will receive advice from the Advisor but will <b><i>not</i></b> know the quality of the investment opportunity when you decide to invest.</p>

<p>Each Investor’s endowment will be randomly drawn from the numbers between 1 and 300. There is a separate draw for each Investor, so knowing your endowment does not tell you anything about the endowments of other Investors. As an Investor, you will use a slider to select the minimum endowment for which you will choose Keep <b><i>if the Advisor’s advice is Invest</i></b>. Your best choice is to set the slider exactly <span style="color: red;">equal</span> to the value you believe you will earn on average by choosing Invest.</p>
