<p>Investors who choose Invest will earn 300 if the majority of Investors in their group (three or more) choose Invest <b><i>and</i></b> <i>Quality</i> is High. Unlike Decision 2, the payoff of an Investor depends on the quality of the investment opportunity.</p>

<p>As in Decisions 1 and 2, any Investor who chooses Keep will receive their endowment, which will be drawn at random. There is a separate draw for each Investor, so knowing your endowment does not tell you anything about the endowments of other Investors. As an Investor, you will again use the slider to identify the minimum value of the outside option that will lead you to choose Keep; otherwise, you will choose Invest. As shown in the example previously, your best choice is to set the slider exactly equal to the value you believe you will earn on average by choosing Invest.</p>
