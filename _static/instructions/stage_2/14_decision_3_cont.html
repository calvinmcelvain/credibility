<p>In Stage 3, the payoff table for Investors will change. Investors  who choose to invest will earn 300 if the majority of Investors in their group (three or more) choose to invest <b><i>and</i></b> the Quality is High. Unlike Decision 2, the payoff of an Investor <b><i>depends on the quality of the investment.</i></b></p>
{{ include '_static/tables/payoff_tables/stage_2/investor.html' }}
<p>As in Decision 1, any Investor who chooses not to invest will receive their outside option which will be randomly chosen from the numbers between 1 and 300. Investors will again use a slider to choose the minimum outside option for which they will <b><i>not</i></b> invest.</p>
