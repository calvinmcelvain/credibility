<p>After each round, you will receive feedback. This will show you the twenty randomly drawn outside options. For each outside option, the feedback will show you four things:</p>
<div class="List">
    <ul>
        <li>The value of the outside option.</li>
        <li>What you earned given the minimum outside option you chose using the slider (”Your Choice”)</li>
        <li>What you would have earned if you had set the minimum outside option equal to the value as we advise (“Our Advice”)</li>
        <li>The difference between what you would have earned from following our advice and what you earned from your choice.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>As an investor, your best choice is always to set the slider exactly <span style="color: red">equal</span> to the value.</p>
<p>The feedback will highlight in <span style="background-color: greenyellow">green</span> all cases where you earned <b><i>more</i></b> from your choice than if you had followed our advice.</p>
<p>The feedback will highlight in <span style="background-color: red">red</span> all cases where you earned <b><i>less</i></b> from your choice than if you had followed our advice.</p>
