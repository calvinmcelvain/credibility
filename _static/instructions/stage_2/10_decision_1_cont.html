<p>Investors’ payoffs are determined by the table shown below. Investors who choose Invest will receive earnings of 300 if <i>Quality</i> is High, <b><i>regardless of the number of other Investors who choose Invest</i></b>.</p>
<p>As in Stage 1, you will receive advice from the Advisor but will <b><i>not</i></b> know the quality of the investment opportunity when you decide to invest.</p>

<p>Each Investor’s endowment will be randomly drawn from the numbers between 1 and 300. There is a separate draw for each Investor, so knowing your endowment does not tell you anything about the endowments of other Investors. As an Investor, you will use a slider to select a minimum endowment for which you will choose Keep and receive your endowment; otherwise, you will choose Invest. As shown in the example previously, your best choice is to set the slider exactly equal to the value you believe you will earn on average by choosing Invest.</p>
