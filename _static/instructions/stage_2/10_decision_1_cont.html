<p>Investorsâ€™ payoffs <b><i>if they choose to invest</i></b> are determined by the table shown below. Investors who invest will receive earnings of 300 if the Quality is High, <b><i>regardless of the number of other Investors who invest.</i></b></p>
<p>As before, you will receive a recommendation from the Advisor but will not know the quality level of the investment opportunity when you decide to invest.</p>

<p>The outside option will be randomly drawn from the numbers between 1 and 300. Investors will select a mininum outside option for which you will choose to invest, otherwise, you will receive your minimum outside option. We advise you to set the slider <span style="color: red">equal</span> to the outside option where you would switch from choosing to invest to taking the outside option. This will always earn you at least as much money as you would have earned by choosing something else.</p>
