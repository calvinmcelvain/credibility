<div class="List">
    <ol>
        <li>The payoff tables will change for each decision in Stage 2. Be certain to look at the payoff tables and instructions before making your decisions in Stage 2, as these will <b><i>not</i></b> be the same as Stage 1 or the other decisions in Stage 2.</li>
        <li>The outside option is <b><i>not</i></b> the same for every decision in Stage 2. Instead, an outside option will be randomly drawn for each decision. The next few screens explain exactly how this works and how Investors will choose whether or not to invest.</li>
