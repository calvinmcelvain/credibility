<p>There are a number of differences between Stage 1 and Stage 2.</p>
<div class="List">
    <ol>
        <li>The payoff tables will change for each decision in Stage 2. Be certain to look at the payoff tables and instructions before making your decisions in Stage 2, as these will <b><i>not</i></b> be the same as Stage 1 or the other decisions in Stage 2.</li>
        <li>In every round of Stage 1, the investors’ initial endowments were always 12 ECU. This is not true in Stage 2. Instead, for each round, an endowment will be randomly drawn for each Investor. The next few screens explain exactly how this works and how Investors will choose between “Invest” and “Keep”.</li>
